Disclaimer: This is not a guide on how I rice my Window manager, what terminal I use, it's purely how I use my tools.

### How do I have my developer workflow setup?

The time has come, I will show you what my developer workflow is and how I use all the tools and become a PRO developer!

#### What I don't think about?

- GPU rendered terminals "_cough, cough Alacritty_".
- Ricing my desktop, color-schemes.

#### What matters

- It's fast
- Lower mental overhead

### The tools I use for the perfect developer workflow! (for me)

- Linux (duh!)
- Window Manger - Hyprland - and yes I have disabled animations.
- Terminal - foot (cause I use Wayland)
- Terminal multiplexer - Tmux

So if you are using Mac, great! It's still better, try to replicate this and find tools that make you fast and productive.
If you use Windows, upgrade your RAM and play some games, that's all I can say.

### Window management

So on most common Linux Distros, you will find either GNOME or KDE Plasma installed, which are great and part of the reason why Linux has gotten so good in recent years. But, I don't use them - just because I don't want to touch my mouse everytime some new window pops up and drag it somewhere else to see the window behind and all, ugh it's a waste of time as well as mental energy.

That's why I use a window manager!
Now you can go into the rabit hole find all the Window managers you can and then brag about them on Reddit, we are not going to do that, choose what you prefer and stick with it.

So what I what is I don't want any mental burden when I want to go to my browser or terminal or Discord. I just want to get there without thinking, cause this is why humans have muscle memory!

I have set my ALT key as MainMod and when I press :

- `Alt + 1`, I go to my browser on 1st workspace.
- `Alt + 2`, I go to my terminal on 2nd workspace.

and soo on which are usually maximised.

This will help you most fast between your stuff and not worry about their positions.

#### Tiling

As the name suggests, Tiling Window Manager auto tiles and splits your windows, whenever a new window appears, your can see an example in the gif below.
