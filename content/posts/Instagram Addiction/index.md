We all know Instagram has become an essential part of our everyday life. Everyone we meet has an account. If you think about deleting it, a thought comes to your mind, Will I be able to connect with everyone?. The answer is simply no.

But you realize spending hours on any social media app is what these companies want from you. The Instagram app is designed in a way that once anyone opens it, they are most likely to scroll for hours.

What should you do then? The best way is to use the web version of Instagram. You might ask why. Let me explain.

### Reels

The most addictive thing Instagram has is the reels feature. You just keep scrolling and scrolling, it doesn't end. The web doesn't have this section. What the web version does is, displays those reels as videos posted on Instagram. So, you have to manually click them to play. This increases the friction with interaction and reduces the addiction.

### Smooth Navigation

The web version lacks smoothly integrated gestures and makes it not user-friendly.

### The Best way to do it

If you donâ€™t want to go to your browser every time you want to open Instagram then I have got the best way to do it, follow the steps below.

Download and install the app called Native Alpha from here.

This app lets you transform a website to look like an app and creates shortcuts on your homescreen. Open the app and click on the + button below to add the URL.

### Tutorial

This will create a shortcut and get an icon automatically. Open the shortcut and log in to your account as you would on any browser.

Now every time you open the shortcut it will open as an app free of distractions and will boost your productivity!

Other apps
You can use this app for several websites such as Tik-Tok, Facebook, Google, and Youtube too!
