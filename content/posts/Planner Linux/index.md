Planner was developed as a task manager in 2018 and is now a project manager.

Some of the main features are:
- It can synchronize to a Todoist account.
- You can set up tags, due dates, and remainders.
- It supports a dark theme.
- It helps you organize individual projects.

Planner is available on Flathub, Elementary OS App Centre, and Arch user repository.

## Features

1. You can start by creating named Projects. There are options for selecting colors and emojis for a specific project.

2. You can add specific projects to favorites.
3. You can add a task to a project by pressing the "+" icon on the bottom right, then you can add a title to the task, write a description and add links to it too! Pretty cool right?
