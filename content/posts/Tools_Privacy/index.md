Privacy is a fundamental human right. Yet, most people choose convenience and don't consider privacy much. Setting up things for privacy and security can be frustrating and takes real work, but these tools will provide you with that experience.

Here is the list of 10 tools that can make your Privacy and Security more convenient. These are unordered.

## 1. USB Data Blocker

A [USB data blocker](https://amzn.to/3QlkVvm) is a device that allows you to plug into USB charging ports including charging kiosks, and USB ports on gadgets owned by other people. If you connect your devices to a wireless or wired public internet connection, or a USB power charging station, it's difficult to tell how safe they'll be. You can be a victim of juice jacking, which is stealing data or loading malware through USB ports.

These allow you to charge your device but remove the possibility of data flow while traveling, in airports or hotels. Android and iOS can prevent these breaches, but they are software workarounds.

If you want to keep your mobile devices safe, use a USB Data blocker. These are cheap and portable.

## 2. Mobile Device Protection

- Privacy Screen Protector-These are screen guards which prevent anyone from peeking into your phone from side angles.
- Web-Cam Cover - As the name suggests, these small devices can save you from unauthorized camera access. Nowadays, some laptops come with these, you can use [sliding covers](https://amzn.to/3w19Qrm) or phone cases with guards.
- Dongle- If your device doesn't have a 3.5 mm audio jack, you can use [USB-C to 3.5 mm Dongle](https://amzn.to/3w2g9e1) to avoid using Bluetooth, which comes with a security risk.

## 3. External HDD or SSD Storage

<img class="special-img-class" src="/2022/tools-privacy-security/ssd.jpg"/>

External [Hard-drive(HDD)](https://amzn.to/3dpOY6A) or [SSD](https://amzn.to/3dsOhtj) can be used for backing up your data. These storage devices provide excellent security when encrypted by software such as [VeraCrypt](https://www.veracrypt.fr/code/VeraCrypt/). Photos, Videos, Notes, or any data can be stored without relying on Cloud Storage or any insecure place which doesn't encrypt your data.

## 4. External USB

An [external USB](https://amzn.to/3dsN5pV) or [Flash Drives](https://amzn.to/3QtNTcM) are great tools and provide the same benefit. Another benefit of using Flash Drives are great for live operating systems. You can boot and use them anywhere, or they can be used to recover Windows. 

They are also useful for storing passwords and can also be encrypted for better security.
## 5. USB External Webcam and Microphone

<img class="special-img-class" src="/2022/tools-privacy-security/webcam.jpg"/>

Using an [external webcam](https://amzn.to/3dtSqx9) can be really beneficial, you can physically unplug it when not in use and prevent unauthorized access. By using it, you can permanently cover on-device webcam.

Similarly, I recommend using an external microphone.
## 6. Cryptocurrency Hardware Wallet

With the growing popularity of Cryptocurrencies and their valid use-cases, you need a wallet to store them. You can't rely on an online or digital Wallet.

Hardware wallets are excellent and secure method of storing cryptocurrencies.
## 7. Router

<img class="special-img-class" src="/2022/tools-privacy-security/router.jpg"/>

You might not consider a [Router](https://amzn.to/3pjkpSE), but all the devices are connected to it. It is one of the most targeted devices and are vulnerable to attack. I recommend you to choose a router that supports custom firmware like [OpenWrt](https://openwrt.org/).

Do your research before buying a router, and also look for documentation. 
## 8. Raspberry Pi/ DIY Projects

<img class="special-img-class" src="/2022/tools-privacy-security/rasp-pi.jpg"/>

The Raspberry Pi is a low cost, credit-card sized computer that plugs into almost anything. It is a capable little device that enables people of all ages to explore computing, and to learn how to program.

Look into DIY projects online. It can be configured and used as a home storage, home security camera hub, personal computer or server, firewalls, smart device, etc. 
## 9. Hardware

<img class="special-img-class" src="/2022/tools-privacy-security/hardware.jpg"/>

You can use pre-built hardware PCs or laptops that come with Linux installed out of the box. You can verify the components, and the software is fully open source. Likewise, you can pick the products from [system76](https://system76.com/), [starlabs](https://in.starlabs.systems/), [pine64](https://www.pine64.org/) and other Linux based manufacturers. HP and Lenovo also make Linux based laptops, you can check them too.

The [iPad](https://amzn.to/3C3XpyQ) and the [Chromebooks](https://amzn.to/3QLLp9n) are considered best for security and convenience. They are not open-source and privacy-friendly. They provide extreme security and are designed to take on traditional attacks.
## 10. Faraday Bagpacks

<img class="special-img-class" src="/2022/tools-privacy-security/faraday-bags.jpg"/>

This is the extreme-advanced case, these are the pouches created to eliminate all radio signals coming and going out of the bag including cellular, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. These come with a lot of sizes and can be used while travelling.

Thank you for going through the list. Hope this gives you some ideas and helps you choose according to your threat model.
