You might have seen many people in productivity videos using multiple or wide-angle screens, and it might feel straightforward to believe that using multiple displays might improve productivity. However, it’s actually the opposite. How so?

The best analogy I can think of is typing on a keyboard. The main reason people use touch typing to type fast is that it doesn’t make you look down at the keyboard while you're focused on the task. It makes you much faster than looking down. Looking at a secondary or multiple screens is similar. But what’s the proof of it, you might ask.

## The Benefits

You may have seen people wearing hoodies or hats while they focus on something. This is beneficial because of how our brain works: when focused on one “not-big” area, it becomes alert and reduces distractions. I’m not saying you’ll definitely have distractions on other screens, but using a single screen can reduce eye and brain fatigue by minimizing the need to switch and process information across different places.

In a podcast by Andrew Huberman called "Optimizing Workspace for Productivity, Focus, & Creativity," he discusses the benefits of narrow vision. Huberman recommends practicing either narrowing or broadening your visual focus. Narrow screens, like those on laptops, help us stay focused by limiting our visual area and keeping distractions at bay. Looking at a smaller screen is like putting "invisible blinders" on, similar to a horse’s blinders, which keep it looking straight ahead.

This keeps our gaze steady and focused, allowing us to concentrate better. When using large monitors, our eyes tend to roam beyond this focus area, making it harder to stay attentive. Smaller screens keep our eyes in “focused mode,” which is ideal for paying attention to details. Simple tricks like cupping hands around the eyes or wearing a hat to block side vision also help keep us focused.

I don’t recommend using smaller screens like a phone or tablet for work, as the font size on these devices might defeat the purpose by straining your eyes with small fonts.

## Ergonomics

Ergonomic research suggests that a single screen positioned directly in front of the user at eye level and within a 40–70 cm range promotes visual comfort and reduces neck strain. Dual screens, though useful for multitasking, often require side-to-side head movement, increasing neck and shoulder muscle load. Using a single screen helps maintain a stable head posture, minimizing muscle strain and enhancing ergonomic comfort.

### Taking It One Step Further

Now that we’ve discussed the benefits, the question remains: how to optimize this for a faster workflow?

There are many ways to take this to the next level:

### 1. Using Keyboard Shortcuts to Move Between Windows or Workspaces

Just like with typing, you can use the same skill to move quickly between windows or workspaces by pressing shortcut keys. Whatever operating system you’re using, there’s always an option to set quick shortcuts to achieve this.

### 2. Using a Tiling Window Manager or Extension

A tiling window manager arranges open windows into non-overlapping tiles, keeping everything visible and organized on one screen. This setup, popular with Linux users, maximizes screen space and reduces the need to switch between windows. Non-Linux users can achieve similar results with tools like Microsoft PowerToys (Windows) or Rectangle (macOS), making workflows faster and more efficient.

### 3. Experiment

This varies from person to person, but the key is to create a workflow tailored to your own needs and habits. This makes it both interesting and challenging. It’s like creating your computer’s identity, one that’s unique to you.

## Situations Where a Multi/Wide Setup Can Be Useful

As we discussed, using a single screen can be very helpful for productivity, ergonomics, and other aspects. However, there are still some situations where a multi-monitor setup can be useful:

As open-minded individuals, let’s consider these valid and important use cases:

1. **Creative & Design Work**: Designers and video editors can separate their workspace from tools and previews, improving workflow.

2. **Gaming & Entertainment**: Gamers and media consumers use wide screens for immersive gaming, and streamers can use a secondary monitor for reading chats, etc.

## Conclusion

While using a single screen setup can improve focus, reduce distractions, and enhance ergonomic comfort, it’s not a one-size-fits-all solution. Different people may find that multiple screens work better for their workflow, especially if their tasks involve design, analysis, or other highly visual work. Productivity setups are highly personal, and optimizing them often requires a bit of experimentation.

Ultimately, it’s about finding what works best for you and adjusting your workspace to support your needs and goals. If you have other tips or experiences with different setups, I’d love to hear your suggestions in the comments. Thank you!
