Privacy? There is no way we can become private in today's world..but we can take some steps.

User privacy has become an enormous issue as data collection, tracking for ads, and marketing purposes have been a massive increase. One of the core things for which we use smartphones is messaging. And users want their chats, voice messages, and data to be private and secure.

But why do you need them?

By using apps like WhatsApp, Google messages, and Apple Messages, we give our most valuable data to these tech giants. No matter how trustworthy they seem, there is a huge chance that data might get leaked or used for advertisement purposes.

We have seen a lot of data breaches and data mishandling in the past two decades. You can read this article from the Cupwire about every privacy breach that Google has done over the past decade.

If you think WhatsApp uses end-to-end encryption in their messages, it's true, but they still collect metadata like with whom you are talking or for what time you do that and that's a lot of information! The same goes for all other messaging apps.

The best way by which we can keep our chats private is by making use of some private messaging apps.

Top 5 Private messengers
## 5. Telegram

Telegram is an alternative to WhatsApp, which provide some additional features.

Telegram comes with a ton of features such as Group support, channels, video, audio calls, customizing colors, and extensive sticker support. It requires you to use your phone number, but there is also an option to use a username and hide your phone number. There is an upcoming feature that will be built-in ads. End-to-end encryption is not turned on by default.

Overall great app, with a lot of customization, and the possible addition of ads, that’s why it's on number 5.

## 4. Matrix

Matrix is an open-source project, decentralized protocol.

The most common client named Element can be used. Matrix overall is a good improvement over Telegram and provides end-to-end encryption by default. It also supports the group feature.

There is a “rooms” feature which are groups for communities. There are few home servers that require only a username and password for registration and no personal information. You can connect with other people with different home servers. Usability and features may depend on the client you use.

Sometimes it feels slow due to different servers and may not work for people who need a simple solution.

Overall, privacy and security are excellent and fit the needs of many people, speed, and usability might be an issue for some people.

## 3. Session

It is a new project which has some unique features!

Session does not collect any personal information, is open-source, and doesn't require phone numbers. It onion-routes its messages and collects close to zero metadata.

It can feel a lot slow while sending messages and joining groups, and the apps contain a lot of bugs. There is no support for audio and video calls, but audio messages and stickers can be sent. It is a minimal which might be a good thing. It implements cryptocurrency into the app, which some people might dislike.

Furthermore, it is definitely a very good private messenger and usage of onion routing can be really useful. Give it a try.

## 2.Signal

Signal is considered the best messenger and maintains its standard. Everything is end-to-end encrypted. It is designed in a way that will keep your data secure even when its server is compromised.

It also has some great features like disappearing messages and sealed sender. It is a really polished experience with all features like voice and video calls, stickers, and minimal design. It comes with a “Note to Self” feature and can be used as the default SMS app too! Backup is stored on device.

It requires a phone number, which is a drawback. It will also integrate cryptocurrency directly into the app, which can be a concern for some people.

It is highly recommended for WhatsApp users who might want to switch to private messengers.

## 1.Briar

Briar is a peer-to-peer encrypted messenger through Tor. It doesn’t use any central server, and messages stay between the person using them.

It doesn’t require anything other than a username and password for registration. It is only available for android and there is also a PC client available. Likewise, it is only used for text messaging and doesn’t support audio and video calls. It requires users to be online at the same time as it is peer-to-peer.

You can also use it without even the internet!

### Conclusion:
These are some best secure and private messages, anyone can choose one according to their preferences.
