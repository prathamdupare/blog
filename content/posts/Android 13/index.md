Google released [Android 13 beta 3](https://www.tomsguide.com/news/android-13-beta-3-has-arrived-heres-whats-new) in June, and we just got [Android 13 beta 4](https://www.tomsguide.com/news/android-13s-final-beta-is-here-and-the-official-release-is-weeks-away) in July.

Beta-3 gave us new taskbar support and multi-window mode which are better optimized for bigger screens, Beta 4 came with stability improvements.
In no time, we will get a stable release.

These are the new features coming to Android 13.

## Android 13 features

- **3D experience**- Google is working on providing you 3D experience with paired audio and android devices.

- **Bluetooth LE Audio** - Latest Bluetooth version support needs less power, multi-device support, and reduced stuttering. This is present in Android 13.

- **Photo Picker** - This privacy-friendly feature lets users choose whether to share a specific photo to an app or to the whole gallery. This way, apps can only access the file which you want.

- **Nearby Wi-Fi device permission** - This NEARBY_WIFI_DEVICES feature allows apps to access to Wi-Fi access points, which limits the data shared with an external app.

- **Material You app theming** - Android 12 supports wallpaper based theming for google apps only, Android 13 extends this to third-party apps too.
- **Copied text** - This feature lets users edit the copied text before it gets saved, just like the screenshot feature. If you have copied a hyperlink, a pop-up comes to open it in Chrome.

- **New QR code scanner** - We already know Android 13 comes with a feature that adds a QR scanner in quick style settings. Another option will add a scanner to the lock screen.

- **Tap-To-Transfer** - Android 13 might be adding a "Media Tap-to-Transfer" option, which would allow the user to tap their phone to some other device to transfer media playback to it. This is still unclear how this will work.

- **Separate media access** - Apps will have to request access to your media files separately. This includes photos, videos, and audio files.

- **Adjustable Flashlight** - [Esper](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-flashlight-brightness-control/) has found commands in the developer beta that suggest Android 13 will let you control the brightness of the flashlight rather than simply turning it on and off. This feature was already present on iOS.

- **App Archive** - Google announced a new feature that will allow apps to be installed in an archived form, which will reduce storage usage and use the files when they are needed.

- **Notification permission on first launch** - This feature will let you deny notification permission on the first launch.

- **MIDI 2.0 support** - Android 13 will also add support for MIDI 2.0 devices.

- **Auto clipboard history deletion** - Android 13 will be able to auto-delete your clipboard history.

## Android 13 release date?

If you are familiar with Android 12's rollout, you can guess when Android 13 will get released.
After releasing [Android 13 beta 4](https://www.tomsguide.com/news/android-13s-final-beta-is-here-and-the-official-release-is-weeks-away) Google described the release as weeks away. So it looks like Android 13 will release in August 2022.
