## What is Chrome OS Flex?

Chrome OS Flex is a new version of Chrome OS thatâ€™s designed for businesses and schools to install and run on old PCs and Macs. It was created after Google aquired Neverware which was a company that provided Chrome OS for older PCs. Earlier this year, Google released it as early access preview. 

### Support

Chrome OS Flex currently supports Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo, LG, Toshiba, and many more OEMs. Older MacBooks also support it. It is targeted towards old PCs and Macs and that makes it stand out. You can find the list of supported devices [here](https://support.google.com/chromeosflex/answer/11513094#zippy=%2Capple).
Even if your device is not listed aboove, you can try Chrome OS Flex without installing and see how it works. It might have some minor issues with boot and stability.
