## Expansion

I bought the domain fosspage.com about three years ago and have been using it for my blog, portfolio, and other projects. But now, I want to expand it!

### The Plan

I plan to transform fosspage.com into an open-source tools website to help users live distraction-free lives without sacrificing their social interactions. Here are some of the projects I have planned:

They are named after various retro items.

1. **HourGlass (Android)** - An NTFY server for messages, possibly including a calendar.
2. **Pager (Android)** - A notification manager built with React Native.
3. **Typewriter** - A simple writing tool without any fancy distraction buttons, featuring a vim mode.
4. **PostCard** - A Gmail parser that generates summaries and categorizes emails.
5. **YouTube Focus** - A CRT-themed tool to help focus while using YouTube.

I have already created a landing page for this, which still needs work. It will also feature a sponsors page where other developers can showcase their tools. Additionally, I have set up a GitHub organization under my account that will host these repositories. The link is [here](https://github.com/orgs/fosspage/repositories).

There's a lot to work on, but I'm excited to get started!

## React Native and Expo

This initiative pushed me to learn React Native and Expo, which I successfully did by building a meditation app. You can find it [here](https://github.com/prathamdupare/simple-meditation). It was a great tutorial and learning experience, and now it's time to dive deeper. Expo is excellent for the mobile apps in this project, and although I'm not aiming to write perfect code, this process will help me learn.

Also, I'll need to pay the yearly domain fee, so if anyone has any work for me, let me know! LOL!

## Other Projects

I've been working on a big project. If you're interested, visit my GitHub, which features that dopamine-releasing green heat graph. Otherwise, you'll get all the updates here.

I'm setting a deadline to complete at least two projects by the end of this month because July 26 is reserved for Deadpool and Wolverine! ðŸ˜‚
