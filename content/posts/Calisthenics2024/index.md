### The Journey

I began my calisthenics journey during lockdown, working out inside my house while following online workout tutorials. Initially, I struggled to do even one pull-up. Determined, I trained every day, and within a month, I achieved my first pull-up. Lacking workout buddies, I enlisted my younger brothers as training partners.

After a few months, I transitioned to a gym, where my prior calisthenics training gave me an advantage over typical beginners. Although I enjoyed the weights and evening gym sessions with friends, I missed the fresh air and morning pull-up challenges. Consequently, after a month, I returned to classic calisthenics workouts.

A year later, I could hold a handstand, perform 30-40 pull-ups, and do 15-20 dips consecutively. However, as the lockdown ended and college resumed, my routine became inconsistent, slowing down my progress. I adapted by incorporating calisthenics into gym sessions, both in the morning and evening. Nevertheless, my progress plateaued.

Realizing the need for variety, I introduced weights into my workouts, purchasing a weighted belt for weighted dips and pull-ups. Soon, I excelled in these exercises, particularly in push movements, which have always been a strength. Balancing workouts with study and other skills, my current strength and skills are as follows:

### Current Skills and Strength
