What is FOSS? It stands for Free and Open Source Software.


FOSS is any software that is freely licensed to use, whose code is open and can be copied and changed by anyone, and can be improved by anyone. Most software products you use are proprietary, and it is improbable that you will come across any open-source software.

FOSS is the opposite of proprietary software, which is under copyright and the source code is hidden. Most companies use this software on desktop and mobile operating systems.

## Benefits of using FOSS
It is best for privacy and security, which is essential in today's world. Unlike closed-source software that can access private data or can contain undesired features, FOSS’s source code is open and anyone can analyze and look for any malicious code and verify it.

You might ask if it is open-source, doesn't that make it more vulnerable to hackers and viruses? That's not the case, since the code is public many people can fix it and make it as secure as possible. It gives freedom to change and modify as per needs, provides much more control over data, and doesn’t force anyone to stick to one ecosystem.

It is free and doesn't cost you anything thanks to the developers who make this possible and mainly rely on donations. A large community that is always ready for support and assistance. These are just a few of the benefits which you get, the possibilities are endless! Almost every closed-source software has an open-source alternative that you can use.

## Conclusion
If you want full control over your data or want everything to be transparent, go for it! Now you know the benefits of using FOSS, and why it's important in our life.
