[Linux 5.19](https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-5.19-Released) as announced yesterday, Linux 5.20 will most likely be called Linux 6.0.

Linus Torvalds' versioning after 19~20 point releases has been when he bumps to the next major version number... **Linux 4.0** came after **Linux 3.19 **while **Linux 4.20** became **Linux 5.0**.

Following the same trend we will most likely get Linux 6.0. In Sunday's Linux 5.19 announcement, he teased that the next kernel version will likely be 6.0.

He said, "I'll likely call it 6.0 since I'm starting to worry about getting confused by big numbers again."
So all the big features coming for **Linux 5.20** will likely be released as **Linux 6.0**.
